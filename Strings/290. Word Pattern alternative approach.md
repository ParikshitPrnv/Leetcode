Approach 2: Single Index Hash Map
Intuition

Rather than having two hash maps, we can have a single index hash map which keeps track of the first occurrences of each character in pattern and each word in s. As we go through each character-word pair, we insert unseen characters from pattern and unseen words from s.

The goal is to make sure that the indices of each character and word match up. As soon as we find a mismatch, we can return False.
